# Hello! ðŸ‘‹
Hello and thanks for passing by!
I think you may be asking:
# What is Carbon Theme?
<p>
Carbon Theme is a dark mode theme, made perfectly for the eyes of every programmer!
</p>

# Why should I use it
<p>
Well the choice is your's!
If you want a theme for your eyes then use this one, and also you would be supporting the theme by just using it! So I would be thankful if you use it.
